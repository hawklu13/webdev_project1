		<ol>Derrick Rose is my favorite basketball player of all time.  Hes very flashy and fun to watch.  He always finds a way to get to the rim and lay up the ball.  Hes very fast and I love the fact he is from chicago.  
		hes a hometown hero of sorts.  I wish his career didnt get cut short.  He is chicagos MVP.</ol>
    <li>Demar Derozan</li>

		<ol>Demar was traded to the bulls in the 2021 season.  He surprised everyone with how good of a scorer and how clutch he was.  He won us a lot of games with his clutch ability.  He got traded not too long ago, 
		but I am happy he played for us and he can thrive on his new team.</ol>
	<li>Matas Buzelis</li> 
		<img src="Images/matas.jpg" alt="Picture of Matas Buzelis" width = "400" height = "450">
		<ol>Matas Buzelis is a rookie, just got drafted this past year.  He is from the suburbs of chicago so I like that about him.  Hes a great dunker and plays really good defense.
		Hope he can show us some more of his potential soon.</ol>
    <h2>My Favorite Game Attended</h2>
