    <h1>Chicago Bears</h1>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Players</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Justin Fields</strong><br>

            <p>Justin Fields is my favorite player who has played for the Chicago Bears. Before he got traded, he was one of the most electric and fun players to watch. 
            He could always evade pressure and run for a touchdown if defenders didn't stop him.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>DJ Moore</strong><br>
            <img src="Images/djmoore.jpg" alt="Picture of DJ Moore" width="400" height="450">
            <p>DJ Moore is one of my favorite players. He's more quiet and reserved compared to other players at his position, but I like his humility. 
            Ever since he got traded here, he's been a hard worker and a great player for the Bears.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Caleb Williams</strong><br>
            <img src="Images/calebwilliams.jpg" alt="Picture of Caleb Williams" width="400" height="450">
            <p>Caleb Williams is my new favorite player. He just got drafted last year, but he's already shown that he can handle the big leagues and looks like a future star. 
            I hope next year he can show his true potential.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favorite Game Attended</h2>
    <img src="Images/gameday.jpg" alt="Picture of Bears Game" width="400" height="450">
    <p>My favorite game that I have attended was Week 12, Bears vs. Vikings. This game was electric, where Caleb Williams threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against a stacked Minnesota defense. 
    The food was pretty good too! My friend and I had a great time.</p>
